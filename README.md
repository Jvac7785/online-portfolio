## Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game development competition where a theme is anounced.
The participants have to make an entire game from scratch with no prexisting assets.

I have preticpated in Ludum Dare multiple times

This was the latest Ludum Dare I preticpated in.
I used a new programing language named Odin, which is similar to Golang.
For rendering entities to the screen I used modern OpenGL.

### Previous Ludum Dare
For previous Ludum Dares I used Unity as a game engine.
